INSTRUCTIONS:

- A demo scene has already been setup with everything needed to use the Season Manager.

- In case of problems please don't hesitate to contact me

*NOTE*

- Asset is a work in progress

- There are only two different instantiated weather effects in use in the demo (rain & snow)

- Seasons, Days & Weather are all created as scriptable Objects and are found under Pluvi

- The shader uses Cubemaps as skybox textures

- Days require a weather asset in order to function
